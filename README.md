Hi John,

Hope you are having a good week. This is just a friendly reminder that in addition to the apps assigned each week, we will also have a collaborative course-wide project. Please fill out this [group survey form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZmThXCQkjnV2olpF2) ASAP so we can match you with a 3 person group and then your team can begin work designing and building a capstone project.

If you have questions regarding this matter, please feel free to let us know. Thanks!

Best,

Michelle Sunga

School Program Coordinator
